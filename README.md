# Greedy Algorithms - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions related to greedy algorithms. Greedy algorithms are a fundamental approach in computer science used to solve optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. I am using the Coder Army Sheet for these questions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pud-vdSPhhljScynHvTUGRE5yxEV6dCMb45rOwoSt_Q/edit#gid=0).
